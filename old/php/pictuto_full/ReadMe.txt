1. These files may be named differently than what we decided in class (ex - instead of _)
2. Some of these files may be stored in a different location (ex root vs includes)
3. There is no db-connect in this set of files - you will need to write your own 
   - but the 'SALT' for the passwords is: 'jdigu42e5w978465goqt53ew99dsq-83ewo51kj51*&^RW*I%J#'
4. There are two sql files. The pictutoFullDBCreate will create a database named: 
   trish2_pictuto0817 if none exists, and then import the data. The pictutoStructureAndData
   will insert tables and data into an already existing database.
5. This is provided to you as an example, but it too is not fully complete. 
    There is more that could be done with this.

I hope this helps.
